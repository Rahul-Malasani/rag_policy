Let\u2019s say if you reduce the current INR 10 lakh Sum Insured to INR 5 lakh, your Booster+ Sum Insured will be halved. \u2022 You can and should regularly increase Sum Insured of your Health insurance policy. Medical inflation is a reality and current Sum Insured will fall short in future for advanced treatments. When you enhance your Sum Insured, the accumulated Booster+ Sum Insured will continue and grow even more (remember Booster+ is up to maximum 3/5/10 times (based on the plan you have chosen) of the Base Sum Insured.
